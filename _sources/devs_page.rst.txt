PhD: 2019-2022

Originated from the upper plateau of the mountains, this specimen may seem almost friendly.
While alpagas are reputed to eat only grass and flowers, this particular seems to have quite an appetite. 
We recommend avoiding any interaction just before lunchtime. 
Friend with the penguins may have trouble understanding Windows users -- or worst: Igor ones.

**Fabien Rondepierre:**

PhD: 2020-2025

This creature is kinda rare. 
One can find him in the deepest cave, or darkest lab room trying to convert red photons into blue ones. 
Disappointed to not be a unicorn, he will always have something on his head to compensate for this injustice. 
Eager to help and friendly with living beings like alpagas, pythons, pandas, and even Igor users as long as you don't steal those preciously collected yogurts from him.
   
**Maxime Fery:**

PhD: 2021-2025

This one comes from the south; he enjoys hot weather, the sea, and ice cream. 
He is also an amateur guitarist, photographer, and enjoys playing all kinds of games.
