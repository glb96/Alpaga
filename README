Alpaga is designed to analyze the output of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) experimental acquisitions.  
It provides a robust automatic procedure to extract the intensity of Gaussian-shaped peaks from spectral data.  
The analysis then continues depending on the type of experiment performed: Surface SHG or Scattering SHG.

The software is written in Python and should be used within Python environments.
